    What Are Benefits of Node JS over Java, PHP and Angular JS?
  </h1>
<p>
  <strong>
    In order to find the benefits of Node JS, we should compare it to other popular platforms. In this post, you will see the pros and cons in comparison to Java, PHP, and Angular JS. Let`s get it started!
  </strong>
</p>
<h2>
  Let`s Start with Java!
</h2>
<p>
  Java is a very popular platform where the developers create object-oriented programs. It is an excellent platform for general-purpose programming. James Gosling is its creator. At the moment one can use this programming language to write a program and run it anywhere. On the other hand, Node JS is popularly called a runtime library. It is also a cross-platform framework that is specifically used to create and run JavaScript applications in mediums other than browsers. It is an open-source and free-to-use tool used by the majority of developers to create JS applications for servers.

</p>


<p>
  The majority of the syntax used in Java is derived and coded using C++. C++ is also a similar programming language with object-oriented and class-based features. It comes in the form Java Development Kit. Most of its elements or components are not required for running Java. The compiler used in this language converts the source program into bytecode thus enabling a user to run it in all operating systems that have a proper Java Runtime Environment (JRE). This is considered to be one of the best benefits of using Java. All you need is an apt JRE. The JREs can be availed from Java’s official website. These JREs are downloaded and easily installed for running the bytecodes.

  Node JS development Service, on the other hand, is offered by the developers for creating real-time application development and mobile application services. Writing scripts can be easily scaled. Usually, the scripts are lighter and easy to execute. Node JS can be used for back-end as well as front-end developments as JavaScript can be used for the same development. A developer using Node JS can conveniently reply to the specific HTTP requests and listen to them. He can also access a database stored in a server and at the same time, listen to the traffic networks. As it follows an event-based operation model, it can address scalability. It also allows the rich libraries of JavaScript for modules and simplifies the process of coding for the developers.

<p>
  Let us summarize the particular differences between Node JS and Java. It will help us to single out the benefits of Node JS and decide if it`s worth it.

</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Creation</h4>

<p>
  Java is an object-oriented and class-based language, specifically derived from the C++ language. Node JS operates on a framework developed using C++, C, and JavaScript.

</p>


<h4 style="text-align: left;">Application</h4>

<p>Java is a language used to create a concurrent application. Node JS is used to create a scalable and fast server-side application. It is used for developing a faster Node JS website for a better user experience. This is one of the most important benefits of Node JS.</p>
<p>Node JS is particularly used for creating small-size applications and other projects whereas, Java is used for complex projects that are web-based and concurrent.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Usage</h4>
<p>Java is popularly used to create various web applications whereas Node JS is preferred for developing faster and scalable applications.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Installation</h4>
<p>The installation of Java needs a proper development kit. Node JS will only need to install archive files on the system.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">Scope</h4>
<p>Using Node JS will give the developers freedom and convenience to utilize the benefits on the server, as well as, client-side. Java is still dominating interactions on the server-side. Java Development is used for object-oriented application development whereas <a href="https://www.motocms.com/blog/en/node-js-for-ecommerce-websites/">Node JS is used for creating real-time applications and platforms</a> such as Google Docs.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">What are the Differences between Java and Node JS?</h3>
<p>Java uses the multithreading concept easily whereas Node JS is based on a different archive-based concept. The highly concurrent projects can be easily handled using Java as it has a great platform to offer easement for the creation of complex applications. Node JS is not made to handle threads which makes it the right choice for simple and faster application development.</p>
<p>Node JS is particularly used for input/output-based applications for the easiest and convenient runtime. For instance, the majority of the applications that are developed for real-time editing, drawing, interacting with hardware, etc are developed using this language. On the contrary, Java is used for the development of intensive tasks and complex computational applications that are used in intricate applications. The benefits of Java are used for heavier computational power platforms.</p>
<p>Java has the richest libraries and excellent frameworks that are used for the development of websites throughout the globe. Node JS is preferred because of its excellent event-driven development model. Despite all the speculations, it depends on the program or application the developer is working on.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Open-Source Framework –&nbsp;Angular JS</h2>
<p><a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Angular JS</a> is another open-source platform used by the Angular JS Development Services for the creation of web applications utilized at the front end. The Angular JS is maintained by world-renowned Google developers. Every challenge imparted in this segment is met with precision by the eminent team. The members address the challenges a developer faces while developing single-page apps.</p>

The Angular JS is maintained by world-renowned Google developers. Every challenge imparted in this segment is met with precision by the eminent team. The members address the challenges a developer faces while developing single-page apps.</p>

<p>Because of the major features of the framework, Angular Js is based on, a core JavaScript file is included in every application. The additional modules and files are then added depending on the features a developer wants in the application. Angular JS is particularly used for the development of dynamic applications for websites. The Angular JS Development service mostly used HTML as the ideal template language. In fact, its syntax is particularly used for expressing the components of the applications briefly.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Benefits of Node JS over Angular JS</h3>
<img src="../../assets/n5.PNG" alt="">

<p>One of the biggest benefits of using Angular JS is its smoother data synchronization among the components, view, and the model. As mentioned earlier, Angular JS is used for easy and quick integration of codes. All the templates are similar to that of the plain and traditional HTML. It also includes the latest terminologies of extended HTML versions. This particular feature is exemplary for both beginners and experts handling Angular JS to create a web app.</p>

<p>Angular JS has a huge potential for building excellent Graphic User Interface (GUI) required for the web programs and dynamic websites. The creation of single-page apps become extremely easy and innovative. Using this framework also allows a developer to <a href="https://www.motocms.com/blog/en/learn-to-code-for-free-websites/">write custom codes in HTML</a>. The integration with other user interface tools also becomes a lot easier while using Angular JS as the framework.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">Creation</h4>
