<h1>
  What is JavaScript? A Definition of the JS Programming Language
</h1>

<p>
  JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that's used for web development, in web applications, for game development, and lots more. It allows you to implement dynamic features on web pages that cannot be done with only HTML and CSS.
</p>
<p>
  Many browsers use JavaScript as a scripting language for doing dynamic things on the web. Any time you see a click-to-show dropdown menu, extra content added to a page, and dynamically changing element colors on a page, to name a few features, you're seeing the effects of JavaScript.

</p>


<h1>
  What Would the Web Look Like Without JavaScript?
</h1>


Without JavaScript, all you would have on the web would be HTML and CSS. These alone limit you to a few web page implementations. 90% (if not more) of your webpages would be static, and you'd only have the dynamic changes like animations that CSS provides.

<h1>
  How JavaScript Makes Things Dynamic
</h1>

<p>
  HTML defines the structure of your web document and the content therein. CSS declares various styles for the contents provided on the web document.

</p>


<p>
  HTML and CSS are often called markup languages rather than programming languages, because they, at their core, provide markups for documents with very little dynamism.

</p>

<p>
  JavaScript, on the other hand, is a dynamic programming language that supports Math calculations, allows you to dynamically add HTML contents to the DOM, creates dynamic style declarations, fetches contents from another website, and lots more.

</p>


<p>
  Before we go into how JavaScript does all of these things, let's look at a quick example.

</p>

<p>
  JavaScript can do a lot more than what I can cover in this article. But to get you started with JS, we'll look at:

<h1>
  How to Use JavaScript in HTML
</h1>
<p>
  Just like with CSS, JavaScript can be used in HTML in various ways, such as:
</p>

<h2>
  1. Inline JavaScript
</h2>

<p>
  Here, you have the JavaScript code in HTML tags in some special JS-based attributes.
</p>

<p>
  For example, HTML tags have event attributes that allow you to execute some code inline when an event is triggered. Here's what I mean:

</p>




<p>
  This is an example of inline JavaScript. The value of onclick can be some Match calculation, a dynamic addition to the DOM – any syntax-valid JavaScript code.
</p>

<h3>
  2. Internal JavaScript, with the script tag
</h3>
<p>
  Just like the style tag for style declarations within an HTML page, the script tag exists for JavaScript. Here's how it's used:

</p>




<p>
  3. External JavaScript
You may want to have your JavaScript code in a different file. External JavaScript allows this. For such uses-cases, here's how it's done:

</p>

<h3>

  Data Types in JavaScript</h3>
  <p>
In JavaScript, data has to be of one type or another. JavaScript needs to know this so that it knows how to use it with other data or how to operate on such data.

</p>


<h1>
  Advantages of JavaScript
</h1>

<h4>
  1. Speed

</h4>
<p>
  Since JavaScript is an ‘interpreted’ language, it reduces the time required by other programming languages like Java for compilation. JavaScript is also a client-side script, speeding up the execution of the program as it saves the time required to connect to the server
</p>

<h4>
  2. Simplicity
</h4>
<p>
  JavaScript is easy to understand and learn. The structure is simple for the users as well as the developers. It is also very feasible to implement, saving developers a lot of money for developing dynamic content for the web.

</p>
<h4>
  3. Popularity
</h4>

<p>
  Since all modern browsers support JavaScript, it is seen almost everywhere. All the famous companies use JavaScript as a tool including Google, Amazon, PayPal, etc.

</p>

<h4>
  4. Interoperability
</h4>
<p>
  JavaScript works perfect with other programming languages and therefore numerous developers prefer it in developing many applications. We can embed it into any webpage or inside the script of another programming language.
</p>

<h4>
  5. Server Load
</h4>

<p>
  As JavaScript operates on the client-side, data validation is possible on the browser itself rather than sending it off to the server. In case of any discrepancy, the whole website needs not to be reloaded. The browser updates only the selected segment of the page.
</p>
<h4>
  6. Rich Interfaces
</h4>
<p>
  JavaScript provides various interfaces to developers for creating catchy webpages. Drag and drop components or sliders may give a rich interface to the webpages. This leads to improved user-interactivity on the webpage.
</p>
<h4>
  7. Extended Functionality
</h4>
<p>
  Third-party add-ons like Greasemonkey (a Mozilla Firefox extension) allow the developers to add snippets of predefined code in their code to save time and money. These add-ons help the developers build JavaScript applications a lot faster and with much more ease than other programming languages.
</p>


<h4>
  8. Versatility
</h4>

<p>
  JavaScript is now capable of front-end as well as back-end development. Back-end development uses NodeJS while many libraries help in front-end development like AngularJS, ReactJS, etc.
</p>

<h4>
  9. Less Overhead
</h4>

<p>
  JavaScript improves the performance of websites and web applications by reducing the code length. The codes contain less overhead with the use of various built-in functions for loops, DOM access, etc.
</p>


<h3>
  Disadvantages of JavaScript
</h3>


<h4>
  1. Client-side Security
</h4>

<p>
  Since the JavaScript code is viewable to the user, others may use it for malicious purposes. These practices may include using the source code without authentication. Also, it is very easy to place some code into the site that compromises the security of data over the website.
</p>

<h4>
  2. Browser Support
</h4>

<p>
  The browser interprets JavaScript differently in different browsers. Thus, the code must be run on various platforms before publishing. The older browsers don’t support some new functions and we need to check them as well.

</p>

<h4>
  3. Lack of Debugging Facility
</h4>
<p>
  Though some HTML editors support debugging, it is not as efficient as other editors like C/C++ editors. Also, as the browser doesn’t show any error, it is difficult for the developer to detect the problem.
</p>

<h4>
  4. Single Inheritance
</h4>

<p>
  JavaScript only supports single inheritance and not multiple inheritance. Some programs may require this object-oriented language characteristic.

</p>

<h4>
  5. Sluggish Bitwise Function
</h4>
<p>
  JavaScript stores a number as a 64-bit floating-point number and operators operate on 32-bit bitwise operands. Thus, JavaScript converts the number to 32-bits signed integers, operates on them and converts them back to 64-bits JavaScript numbers. This continuous conversion takes more time in conversion of number to an integer. This increases the time needed to run the script and reduces its speed.
</p>


<h4>
  6. Rendering Stopped
</h4>


<p>
  A single code error can stop the rendering of the entire JavaScript code on the website. To the user, it looks as if JavaScript was not present. However, the browsers are extremely tolerant of these errors.
</p>


<h2>
Summary
</h2>

<p>
  After weighing the pros and cons of JavaScript we can envision the full picture of this field. While JavaScript is a field with many lucrative advantages, it also suffers from its disadvantages. This article made us understand that JavaScript helps us to decide on where to use JavaScript code so that it could be most effective. We also understood the potential problems we might face while using JavaScript. Meanwhile, you may go through our next blog on JavaScript Architecture.
