    <h1> What is React js </h1>
    <P>
      React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies.

<h2 id="h-react-features"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="React_Features"></span>React Features<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>
<p>React has some core features that make it stand out from other JavaScript libraries. The following sections will introduce you to these features and explain how they contribute to mobile and web application development.</p>

<h3 id="h-jsx">JSX</h3>
<p>JSX is a JavaScript syntax extension used in React element creation. Developers employ it to embed <a href="/tutorials/html-cheat-sheet" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">HTML</a> code in JavaScript objects. As JSX accepts valid JavaScript expressions and function embedding, it can simplify complex code structures.</p>



<p>JSX also helps combat <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cross-Site Scripting</a> (XSS) attacks. By default, React DOM converts values embedded in JSX to strings before rendering them. Consequently, third parties cannot <a href="https://www.contrastsecurity.com/knowledge-hub/glossary/code-injection" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">inject extra code</a> through user input unless it is explicitly written in the application.</p>

<h3 id="h-virtual-dom">Virtual DOM</h3>

<p>The Document Object Model (DOM) presents a web page in a data tree structure. ReactJS stores Virtual DOM trees in the memory. By doing so, React can apply updates to specific parts of the data tree, which is faster than re-rendering the entirety of the DOM tree.</p>


<p>Whenever there’s a change in data, ReactJS will generate a new Virtual DOM tree and compare it with the previous one to find the quickest possible way to implement changes in the real DOM. This process is known as <a href="https://dev.to/koolkishan/what-is-virtual-dom-how-virtual-dom-works-what-is-reconciliation-what-is-diffing-algorithm-what-makes-react-so-fast-327a" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">diffing</a>.</p>

By making sure that UI manipulation only affects specific sections of the real DOM tree, rendering the updated version takes less time and uses fewer resources. The practice greatly benefits large projects with intense user interaction.

<p>Hundreds of major companies worldwide, such as <a href="http://netflix.com" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Netflix</a>, <a href="http://airbnb.com" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Airbnb</a>, and <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">American Express</a>, use React to build their web applications. In the following sections, we’ll discuss the reasons why so many developers choose ReactJS over its competitors.</p>


<h3 id="h-1-easy-to-use">1. Easy to Use</h3>


<p>Developers with JavaScript knowledge can learn how to use React in no time as it relies on plain JavaScript and a component-based approach. It’s possible to start developing web-based applications with React after just a couple of days of studying it.</p>


<p>Even if you aren’t familiar with JavaScript, tons of websites provide <a href="/tutorials/learn-coding-online-for-free/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">coding lessons</a> for free. Once you know the basics of JavaScript, read up on ReactJS to streamline the front-end development process.</p>


<h3 id="h-2-supports-reusable-java-components">2. Supports Reusable Java Components</h3>

<p>React lets you reuse components that have been developed into other applications. Since ReactJS is open source, it’s possible to pre-build components, cutting down on the development time of complex web applications.</p>

<p>What’s more, React allows nesting components in between others to create complex functions without bloating the code. As each component has its own controls, it’s easy to maintain them.</p>


<h3 id="h-3-easier-component-writing">3. Easier Component Writing</h3>


<p>Because of JSX integration, it’s easier to write React components – users can create JavaScript objects combined with HTML typography and tags. JSX also simplifies multiple function rendering, which keeps code lean without reducing the app’s capabilities.</p>

<h3 id="h-4-high-performance">4. High Performance</h3>

<p>As discussed earlier, Virtual DOM allows ReactJS to update the DOM tree in the most efficient way possible. By storing Virtual DOM in the memory, React eliminates excessive re-rendering that may harm performance.</p>

<h3 id="h-5-seo-friendly">5. SEO Friendly</h3>

<p>
  ReactJS may improve the search engine optimization (SEO) of web applications by increasing their performance. Virtual DOM implementation is one of the factors that influence faster page speeds.

Furthermore, React helps search engines navigate web applications by performing server-side rendering. This tackles one of the most significant issues JavaScript-heavy websites encounter, as search engines usually find them challenging and time-consuming to crawl.
